For its operation Amundsen is structured in three services, two backend services develop in Python (Flask/Gunicorn) and a frontend in NodeJS. As data storage layer it uses ElasticSearch and Neo4j or Apache Atlas (Neo4j seem to have more support from the project). Additionally, to index information the service relies in a mechanism to schedule the execution of Python functions (Airflow recommended). The recommended OS to be used as execution platform is a Linux based (used Ubuntu in official Docker images).

Deployment options are standalone or using Docker images with the container orchestrator of choice. The project provides an official Helm chart ( ) to be used in Kubernetes deployment.

Out the box the application does not provide an authentication mechanism. The recommended way is using a OIDC provider. The project documentation provide with the instructions to integrate the chosen OIDC provider using the flaskoidc module of Flask server. If installed using the standalone method, dependencies of each project need to be installed using PIP or NPN (depending of the specific technology).

For new versions, when minor version upgrades, changes should be backwards compatible. As individual services do not state they can be replaced with newer versions without impact (in any case refer to the release notes of the specific version). Mayor versions come with specific upgrade guides which steps need to be follow.
